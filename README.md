# Environmental Trends Analysis

## Overview
This project explores environmental trends using publicly available datasets. The goal is to apply **R** for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization, and to present the findings in a clear, reproducible format.

The analysis demonstrates skills in:
- Data wrangling with `Rbase` and `dplyr`
- Time series analysis
- Visualization with `Rbase`, `ggplot2` and `patchwork`
- Reproducible reporting with R Markdown

## Dataset
- **Name:** Forest Health and Ecological Diversity
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/forest-health-and-ecological-diversity?resource=download
- **Description:** The dataset is a comprehensive collection of ecological and environmental measurements focused on tree characteristics and site conditions. Each record in the dataset represents a distinct tree or plot, with the following features: plot ID, latitude, longitude, DBH (diameter at breast height), tree height, two measurements of crown width, slope, elevation, temperature, humidity, total and available nitrogen & phosphorus in the soil, a measurement of species richness (Menhinick), a measurement of species abundance (Gleason), disturbance level, fire risk index, and tree health status.
