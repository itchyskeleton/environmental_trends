## 🎯 Research Objective

> **Main Question:** Which variables are related to tree health status?

This project provides a complete statistical methodology to analyze the relationships between various environmental and physical factors and tree health outcomes.

### 🔬 Research Questions
- **a)** Is tree height related to tree health status?
- **b)** Is elevation related to tree health status?  
- **c)** Are soil metrics related to tree health status?
- **d)** Is disturbance level related to tree health status?
- **e)** Is fire risk index related to tree health status?

### 🧪 Hypothesis
*Disturbance level and fire risk index will be more strongly related to tree health than other variables.*
